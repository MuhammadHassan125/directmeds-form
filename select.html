                    <p>This medication was a life changer for me. I’m a 49-year-old female. I never had a problem with
                        my weight until after the age of 45. Then during Covid, I gained 30 pounds and got up to 189. I
                        was exercising regularly and trying to eat healthy, but could not lose any weight. I started
                        Tirzepatide and lost 12 pounds the first month. I had very little side effects. The only thing I
                        experienced was fatigue, a slight headache, and I felt very cold. Once I became used to the
                        medication, after a couple of months, those side effects diminished. I’ve been on the medication
                        for 6 months and have lost a total of 56 pounds. I’m now at 133 pounds. My goal weight is 130. I
                        feel better than I did when I was in my 20s and 30s. This medication was life-changing for me.
                        It not only helped me to lose weight, but it also lowered my A1C, lowered my triglycerides, and
                        blood pressure.</p>

                    <p>39-year-old female, starting weight okay. So, I am on my 3rd shot of the lowest dose of 2.5mg. I
                        have had very minimal side effects. My stool is a bit tacky at times, which I combat with fiber
                        gummies. I have lost 14 pounds in less than three weeks!! My appetite is minimal at best, and
                        I've been walking 10k steps a day. I no longer feel ravenous. I can go 12+ hours without eating
                        and feel just fine. I have also simultaneously quit smoking (or greatly reduced) as well as
                        cutting caffeine, and I was afraid that I would be compelled to eat more to compensate, but
                        nope! That urge to bored eat is completely gone!! Like people have said, this is no miracle
                        drug. You have to want to change, but this can help you significantly. My energy is soooo much
                        better. I'm sleeping better. I feel amazing, and it's only week 3!!</p>

                    <p>This medication has changed my life. Not only can I finally lose weight at a reasonable
                        rate/level of effort, I genuinely enjoy exercising because I have the energy. I no longer see
                        exercise as a price I have to pay to lose weight (and then not even lose weight anyway). My
                        appetite has also plummeted. I have to remind myself to eat. There are occasional 'breakthrough'
                        cravings, so I'll let myself have a treat, but after taking one or two bites I can't fathom
                        eating it anymore. I don't know the exact rate that I've lost weight, but I've been on the drug
                        for 4 or 5 months now and have lost about 30 lbs (went from 210 to 180). This is with casual
                        effort where I exercise when I'm up for it (usually 3-4x/week for 45 min). I do not count
                        calories, just eat intuitively. Taking this medication does not make you weak, lazy, or wanting
                        an easy way out (I've heard it all). If offered this medication, please just give it a try! </p>

                        all my cravings for bad food away, no more chips and pizza. I eat a much healthier diet now and
                        like many others eat much less. My heartburn problems are gone and I have a lot more energy.

                    <p>Good results. Immediate appetite suppression starting with the lowest dose. More importantly, my
                        food cravings went away. It takes a couple of weeks, at most, to get through the psychological
                        part of less appetite/less food. You get full quickly, and yet you feel like you still want to
                        eat because your mind is telling you, 'how can you be full already, you've only had 4 bites?' It
                        only takes one or two times of being nauseated or vomiting to remember to eat less. I have lost
                        48 lbs in exactly 7 months, and my hypertension is gone.</p>
